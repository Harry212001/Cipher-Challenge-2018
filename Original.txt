AFTER LAST YEAR'S ADVENTURES IN TURKEY, TRACKING DOWN THE TRUE STORY OF THE LOST LEGION, I NEEDED A BREAK, AND HARRY FIXED UP THE PERFECT GIG FOR ME. HE FOUND OUT THAT THE BRITISH LIBRARY WERE CATALOGUING OLD FOREIGN POLICY PAPERS FROM THE TIME OF QUEEN VICTORIA AND THEY NEEDED A FORGERY EXPERT TO HELP THEM WITH PROVENANCE. HE DIDN'T TELL THEM THAT I WAS AN EXPERT AT FORGERY IN TWO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WAYS!

ANYWAY I SETTLED INTO THE WORK AND GOT REALLY INTO SPYING OVER QUEEN VIC'S SHOULDER, BUT AFTER A BIT I STARTED TO MISS THE ADVENTURE OF WORKING IN HARRY'S WORLD. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL WHAT I WISHED FOR. I DIDN'T KNOW IT, BUT I WAS ABOUT TO BE HIT BY THE KOMPROMAT FILES. THE SIGNS WERE SUBTLE, AND IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO SPOT THEM, BUT GRADUALLY I STARTED TO MAKE THEM OUT, AND LIKE ONE OF THOSE OLD FASHIONED 3D PICTURES, THAT SPRINGS INTO FOCUS WHEN YOU CROSS YOUR EYES AND COUNT TO A HUNDRED, THE TRUTH CRYSTALLISED AND I REALISED THAT I HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR IT ALL ALONG. IT WASN’T THAT I FOUND SOMETHING PARTICULAR. WHAT I NOTICED WAS ACTUALLY AN ABSENCE, A WHOLE COLLECTION OF APPARENTLY UNRELATED THINGS THAT SHOULD HAVE EXISTED BUT DIDN’T. AND JUST AS I HAD FIGURED THAT OUT, SOMEONE, AND BACK THEN I DIDN’T KNOW WHO, WROTE TO TELL ME ABOUT IT. THEY OBVIOUSLY HAD A SENSE OF THE DRAMATIC, AND AN EXCELLENT SENSE OF TIMING. IF THEY HAD SENT IT TO ME EVEN A FEW DAYS BEFORE I WOULD HAVE ASSUMED IT WAS SOME KIND OF CRAZY ADVERTISING STUNT, BUT WHEN THE POSTCARD ARRIVED, IT WAS IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS TO ME WHAT IT REFERRED TO. IT CARRIED JUST THREE WORDS, AND IT DESCRIBED PERFECTLY THE MISSING PIECES IN MY PUZZLE. IT JUST SAID: THE SHADOW ARCHIVE.

YOUR MAJESTY,
IT HAS BEEN MY DEEPEST PLEASURE AND A GREAT PRIVILEGE TO SERVE AS YOU PRIVATE SECRETARY THESE LAST NINE YEARS, AND THOUGH IT WOULD BE MY ARDENT WISH TO CONTINUE TO SERVE YOU THROUGHOUT YOUR REIGN, WE ARE, NONE OF US, IMMORTAL, AND MY THOUGHTS HAVE TURNED TO MY SUCCESSOR.
YOU ARE OF COURSE ENTITLED TO DISREGARD MY ADVICE, HOWEVER I HAVE GIVEN CONSIDERATION TO THE CHANGES IN MY ROLE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AS YOUR EMPIRE HAS GROWN IN MAGNIFICENCE, OTHERS ACROSS OUR CONTINENT HAVE GROWN FRACTIOUS, AND AN INCREASING PORTION OF MY TIME IS SPENT MANAGING THE IMPACT OF THEIR QUARRELS UPON OUR ISLAND. I HAVE FELT, AT TIMES, LIKE STEPHENSON’S DR JEKYLL AS I HAVE MANAGED YOUR HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS AND THE MORE PUBLIC ASPECTS OF YOUR STATE. AT OTHERS I HAVE BEEN PRESSED TO UNDERTAKE THE ROLE OF MR HYDE, FOCUSSING MY RAGE UNDER GREAT PROVOCATION FROM THE POWERS THAT THREATEN TO ASSAIL US. WITH THESE REFLECTIONS I HAVE COME TO THE VIEW THAT THE TIME MAY HAVE COME TO DISSECT THE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECRETARY INTO ITS TWO VERY SEPARATE FUNCTIONS.
THE PUBLIC FACE OF THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD MUST OF COURSE CONTINUE TO BE PRESENTED BY SOMEONE OF GRACE AND DIGNITY WHO CAN COMMAND THE CONFIDENCE OF THE COURTIERS. WE HAVE DISCUSSED AT LENGTH WHO MIGHT FILL THAT ROLE WHEN I EVENTUALLY PASS ON, AND I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE AGREED TO INVITE PONSONBY TO INHERIT THAT MANTLE. HE IS A GOOD MAN AND WILL SERVE YOU WELL. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT FOR THE SAKE OF CONTINUITY HE CONTINUES TO CARRY THE TITLE OF PRIVATE SECRETARY AND WILL BE HAPPY TO PREPARE HIM FOR THIS ROLE. HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME ASPECTS OF MY ACTIVITIES THAT I SUSPECT THAT PONSONBY WOULD STRUGGLE TO ACCOMPLISH AND FOR THOSE I WOULD INVITE YOU TO CONSIDER A NEW POSITION IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD, THAT OF SECRET SECRETARY.
IN THESE QUARRELSOME TIMES IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO COMMISSION ACTIONS OR ENQUIRIES THAT SOME MIGHT REGARD AS BENEATH THE DIGNITY OF THE CROWN. THE SECRET SECRETARY CAN, BY CONCEALING THESE ACTIVITIES, PRESERVE THE REPUTATION OF YOUR GOVERNMENT AS A RELIABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY PARTICIPANT IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, WHILE ALSO PROVIDING YOU AND YOUR MINISTERS WITH THE WEAPONS TO DEFEAT OUR ENEMIES. IF WE SUCCEED AS I HOPE WE WILL, THEN WARS OF THE FUTURE MAY BE WON WITHOUT A SHOT BEING FIRED.
IT IS MY FERVENT HOPE THAT YOU AGREE WITH MY ANALYSIS AND THAT TOGETHER WE CAN MOVE TO ESTABLISH THE NEW OFFICE. I HAVE SEVERAL NAMES THAT I WOULD HUMBLY SUGGEST AS STRONG CANDIDATES FOR THE NEW ROLE. ALL ARE GOOD MEN, WITH MILITARY BACKGROUNDS AND A REPUTATION FOR HONOUR THAT NO-ONE COULD QUESTION. I WILL BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER AT YOUR PLEASURE.
YOUR FAITHFUL SERVANT,
CHARLES GREY

LIFE HAD BEEN RELATIVELY DULL SINCE RETURNING FROM MY WORK WITH HARRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THE BRITISH LIBRARY WAS DELIGHTED TO GET ITS HANDS ON THE ROMAN DIARY AND THE COLLECTOR SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT ME, MAYBE BECAUSE HARRY’S TEAM MADE IT TOO DANGEROUS TO HANG AROUND. I WAS HAPPY TO SETTLE BACK IN TO MY WORK AT THE LIBRARY AND WAS INVOLVED IN A PROJECT TO TRACK DOWN AND CATALOGUE MISSING DOCUMENTS FROM THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY. THEY DETAILED FOREIGN POLICY, WHICH SOUNDS DULL, BUT WITH VICTORIA TAKING AN ACTIVE INTEREST THERE WERE A LOT OF LETTERS BETWEEN DOWNING STREET AND THE PALACE AND I WAS ENJOYING SPYING ON FAMOUS CHARACTERS FROM HISTORY. I REALLY FELT LIKE I WAS GETTING SOME INSIGHT INTO HOW THEY THOUGHT AND HOW THE MODERN WORLD CAME INTO BEING IN THAT TUMULTUOUS PERIOD.

WHILE I WAS MAINLY THERE TO CHECK THE LETTERS FOR AUTHENTICITY, I GOT REALLY INVOLVED IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ALL FITTED TOGETHER, AND PART OF THE JOB WAS TO CROSS CHECK STATEMENTS IN THE LETTERS WITH WHAT WE KNOW ACTUALLY HAPPENED. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WILL PAY A LOT OF MONEY TO OWN A LETTER FROM A ROYAL, SO THE ARCHIVE IS PLAGUED WITH FORGERIES. SOME OF THEM YOU CAN DETECT BY ANALYSING THE PAPER, OTHERS BY THE WRITING STYLE. SOME JUST FALL OVER BECAUSE THE CONTENT IS OUT OF LINE WITH OTHER DOCUMENTS, BUT AS I STUDIED THEM I BEGAN TO REALISE THAT A NUMBER OF THEM HINTED AT EVENTS THAT I COULDN’T FIND IN THE HISTORICAL RECORD. CERTAIN NAMES APPEARED AND WERE CLEARLY IMPORTANT, AND THEN DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY FROM TRACE. DIPLOMATIC INCIDENTS WERE MENTIONED THAT NEVER HAPPENED ACCORDING TO THE HISTORY BOOKS. ONE THING YOU LEARN IN THIS BUSINESS IS THAT THE CIVIL SERVICE NEVER LETS ANY DECISION, HOWEVER SECRET, GO UNRECORDED. OF COURSE THAT MIGHT JUST HAVE MEANT THOSE LETTERS AND DOCUMENTS WERE FAKE, BUT I PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING AN EXCELLENT FORGER, AND I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE THEM. THE PAPER WAS RIGHT, THE INK WAS CHEMICALLY CORRECT AND AGED JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT, AND THE STYLE OF WRITING WAS TOTALLY CONVINCING. AND I WAS CONVINCED. CONVINCED THAT SOMEWHERE THERE MUST BE AN ARCHIVE OF GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS FROM THE PERIOD THAT RECORDED ALL OF THESE MISSING STORIES IN FULL.

THEN I RECEIVED THE MESSAGE ABOUT THE SHADOW ARCHIVE. SOMEONE ELSE KNEW ABOUT IT, AND HAD WORKED OUT THAT I WAS HUNTING FOR IT TOO. THE POSTCARD DIDN’T HELP MUCH, BUT THE EMAILS DID. THE FIRST ONE HAD THE SUBJECT LINE JEKYLL AND HYDE AND WAS ENCRYPTED USING A SIMPLE CAESAR SHIFT TO DISCOURAGE CASUAL INTEREST. IT DIDN’T TAKE ME LONG TO CRACK IT, AND THE NAMES AND DETAILS IT CONTAINED MATCHED THE GROWING LIST OF MYSTERIOUS REFERENCES FROM MY OWN RESEARCH. DOUGLAS BLACK WAS CLEARLY AN IMPORTANT FIGURE, AND I HAD A FEELING THAT HE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE ARCHIVE. THAT FEELING WAS CONFIRMED BY THE SECOND EMAIL, BLACK HEART, THAT I RECEIVED LATER THAT WEEK. AGAIN IT WAS ENCRYPTED BUT THIS TIME USING AN AFFINE SHIFT CIPHER. IT WAS CLEARLY FROM THE SAME INDIVIDUAL - AT THE VERY LEAST WHOEVER WAS SENDING ME THE EMAILS HAD A HABIT OF MISSING THE LETTER R FROM THE WORD "YOUR".

SOMEONE WAS PLAYING GAMES WITH ME, AND I WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO JOIN IN.

SIR CHARLES,

IT IS WITH REGRET THAT I FIND MYSELF IN DISAGREEMENT WITH YOU JUDGEMENT. IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT YOU ARE RIGHT IN ONE REGARD, IT IS TIME TO ESTABLISH THE OFFICE OF SECRET SECRETARY, AND TO TAKE THE SECRET WAR TO OUR ENEMIES. ON ONE SIGNIFICANT POINT HOWEVER, I DO NOT AGREE. THIS ROLE IS NOT SUITED TO GOOD MEN WITH A REPUTATION FOR HONOUR. YOUR SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE CAPITAL IF I WERE LOOKING TO APPOINT A CHIEF OF STAFF OR A NEW FOREIGN SECRETARY, HOWEVER THE TASKS THAT WE BOTH KNOW ARE NECESSARY IF WE ARE TO PROTECT AND EXPAND THE EMPIRE WILL REQUIRE A MAN OF ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT CHARACTER. A RED BLOODED MAN WITH A BLACK HEART.

THERE IS ONE MAN WE BOTH KNOW WHO IS ENTIRELY SUITED TO THE LESS CONGENIAL ASPECTS OF MODERN STATECRAFT, AND I AM SURPRISED THAT YOU DID NOT ADD HIS NAME TO THE LIST - YOU AMERICAN COUSIN DOUGLAS BLACK. BLACK IS A MAN OF SINGULAR TALENTS AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU ACT WITH UTMOST SPEED TO BRING HIM TO LONDON. I BELIEVE THAT HE IS CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH AS YOU, AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PERSUADE HIM TO TAKE UP THE POST OF SECRET SECRETARY. I AM RATHER LOOKING FORWARD TO MY FIRST MEETING WITH MR. BLACK AND I TRUST YOU WILL NOT DISAPPOINT ME IN THIS, BUT IF YOU FIND THAT HE IS NOT AMENABLE TO REASON THEN I WILL FIND ANOTHER WAY TO PERSUADE HIM. A MAN LIKE BLACK ALWAYS HAS A SKELETON OR TWO IN HIS CLOSET!

V.
SOMEONE WAS OBVIOUSLY KEEN THAT I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT DOUGLAS BLACK BUT I WAS LEFT WONDERING WHAT HE HAD TO DO WITH THE SHADOW ARCHIVE. I FOUND SOME TRACES OF HIM IN BOSTON NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS FROM THE PERIOD. THE STORIES STOPPED IN 1873, AROUND THE DATE OF THE LETTERS BETWEEN VICTORIA AND SIR CHARLES, SO I ASSUME HE RETURNED TO ENGLAND THEN, BUT I COULDN’T FIND ANY RECORD OF HIM IN THE IMMIGRATION FILES AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE OFFICIAL RECORD TO SUGGEST THAT HE MET WITH SIR CHARLES, LET ALONE WITH HER MAJESTY. THE TRAIL HAD GONE COLD AND I MIGHT HAVE MOVED ON AT THAT POINT, BUT THEN I GOT THE THIRD EMAIL. THIS TIME IT WAS A KEYWORD CIPHER AND IT TOOK A LITTLE LONGER TO BREAK, THOUGH THE WORD STRUCTURE HELPED A LOT. IT CONFIRMED EVERYTHING I HAD GUESSED SO FAR ABOUT BLACK, AND RAISED A WHOLE LOAD OF NEW QUESTIONS! IT ALSO SUGGESTED THAT I MIGHT FIND ANSWERS IN THE SHADOW ARCHIVE, BUT FIRST I HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IT WAS, AND HOW I COULD GET IN. I STILL CAN’T BELIEVE IT, BUT THE ANSWER CAME FROM A GOOGLE SEARCH. I WAS LOOKING FOR A LOCATION THAT WOULD HAVE PROVIDED BLACK WITH COVER FOR A STREAM OF VISITORS, PREFERABLY IN A CENTRAL LONDON LOCATION, AND WITH FACILITIES FOR SECURE STORAGE OF OFFICIAL RECORDS, AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OPENED IN 1873 OR 1874. I SEARCHED FOR “BLACK, LONDON, 1874” AND I LIKED WHAT I FOUND. AND THAT IS WHY I FOUND MYSELF LYING ON THE ROOF OF THE NORMAN SHAW BUILDINGS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND IN POURING RAIN! I HAD TO FIGURE OUT A WAY OF GETTING INSIDE ONE OF THE MOST SECURE LOCATIONS IN ENGLAND!

HER MAJESTY IS RIGHT, LIFE IN BOSTON IS DULL, BUT NOT DULL ENOUGH TO PERSUADE ME THAT WORKING FOR HER WOULD BE WORTH THE RISK. BUT OF COURSE SHE HAD AN ANSWER FOR THAT. SHE POINTED OUT THAT RETURNING TO THE UNITED STATES CARRIED ITS OWN RISKS.

I HAD KEPT MYSELF AMUSED FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS SEPARATING THE GREEDY AND VENAL FROM THEIR MONEY BY A VARIETY OF MEANS, NOT ALL OF THEM ENTIRELY APPROVED BY THE LAW. I WAS LEFT WONDERING HOW THE QUEEN KNEW ABOUT THAT, AND WHETHER MY COUSIN HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO TELL THE FEDERAL MARSHALLS ABOUT MY ACTIVITIES. DISCRETION SEEMED THE WISE COURSE, AND ANYWAY, HOW OFTEN DO YOU GET A JOB OFFER FROM A QUEEN?

CHARLES HAS DONE A STERLING JOB DEVELOPING A NETWORK OF AGENTS AND HIS INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS HAVE BECOME A KEY PART OF BRITISH DIPLOMACY. THE GROWING INSTABILITY ACROSS EUROPE THREATENS THE EMPIRE, AND IT IS HER MAJESTY’S BELIEF THAT WE WILL NEED TO RESPOND IN KIND TO DESTABILISE OUR ENEMIES BEFORE THEY GROW TOO STRONG. THIS IS A NEW AND DANGEROUS KIND OF WARFARE, BUT COULD, I SUPPOSE, SAVE LIVES, AND WE WILL, IN ANY CASE, NEED TO MATCH OUR ENEMIES IF WE ARE TO STAY AHEAD.

THIS ENTIRE OPERATION MUST BE KEPT SECRET. FIRST FROM OUR ENEMIES, BUT SECOND, AND JUST AS IMPORTANT, FROM THE OFFICIAL MACHINERY OF STATE. HER MAJESTY CANNOT AFFORD THE RISK THAT HER GOVERNMENT COULD BE IMPLICATED IN THESE OPERATIONS, AND SIR CHARLES HAS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE FOREIGN OFFICE MAY HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED. FOR THIS REASON WE NEED TO MOVE SIR CHARLES’ INTELLIGENCE OPERATION TO A MORE SECURE LOCATION. AND I THINK I HAVE AN IDEA WHERE THAT COULD BE!
THE CLUE WAS IN THE NAME. THE BLACK MUSEUM IS WORLD FAMOUS AS THE IN-HOUSE MUSEUM OF CRIME AT NEW SCOTLAND YARD. THE HISTORY BOOKS (OR AT LEAST, WIKIPEDIA) TOLD ME THAT IT HAD BEEN SET UP BY INSPECTOR NEAME AND PC RANDALL SOME TIME AFTER APRIL 1875 AS A WAY TO USE THE PRISONERS’ PROPERTY STORE TO INSTRUCT NEW RECRUITS IN THE ART OF DETECTION. THE NAME FIRST APPEARS IN PUBLIC IN AN ARTICLE IN THE OBSERVER NEWSPAPER IN 1877, AND THE HISTORIANS SAY IT WAS COINED AS A GRISLY HEADLINE BY A JOURNALIST WHO WAS SNUBBED BY NEAME, BUT I AM NOT SO SURE. IT DIDN’T SEEM AN ACCIDENT THAT DOUGLAS BLACK WAS LOOKING TO SET UP A TOP SECRET ARCHIVE IN LONDON AT THAT TIME, AND SCOTLAND YARD GAVE HIM THE PERFECT LOCATION. IT WAS CENTRAL AND EASY TO ACCESS. IT HAD SEVERAL ENTRANCES, WITH A STEADY FLOW OF VISITORS, NOT ALL OF THEM ENTIRELY REPUTABLE, THAT WOULD DISGUISE THE COMINGS AND GOINGS OF THE AGENTS AND OFFICERS OF BLACK’S NETWORK. BEST OF ALL IT HAD THE ENTIRE METROPOLITAN POLICE FORCE STANDING GUARD, WHICH WAS GREAT FOR BLACK, AND TOUGH ON ME. IT WOULD BE THE IDEAL LOCATION FOR THE SHADOW ARCHIVE.
SCOTLAND YARD HAD MOVED TO NEW PREMISES SEVERAL TIMES SINCE IT WAS FIRST SET UP, BUT I WAS BETTING THAT THE SHADOW ARCHIVE HAD MOVED WITH IT, AND I SPENT THE BEST PART OF THREE WEEKS SCOUTING THE NORMAN SHAW BUILDINGS AND THE NEW “NEW SCOTLAND YARD” NEXT DOOR AT THE CURTIS GREEN BUILDING. IT IS NOT EASY TO DO THAT WITHOUT BEING SPOTTED, HENCE THE NIGHT TIME RECONNAISSANCE IN THE RAIN. THE WATER AND THE COLD PLAYED HAVOC WITH MY MOOD, BUT ALSO WITH MANY DETECTOR SYSTEMS SO IT WAS WORTH THE DISCOMFORT.
NO-ONE WAS LIKELY TO GIVE ME THE REAL PLANS OF THE PLACE, THOUGH HARRY WAS HAPPY TO PROVIDE ME WITH A COPY OF THE OFFICIAL LAYOUT, AND I USED A LIDAR SYSTEM TO MAP AS MUCH OF THE OUTSIDE AS I COULD. COMPARING THE TWO SHOULD HAVE REVEALED UNMARKED STORAGE AREAS AND GIVEN ME SOME IDEA HOW I MIGHT GET IN, BUT NOTHING SHOWED UP UNTIL I HAD A LUCKY BREAK. LITERALLY. I HAD LOWERED THE LIDAR DETECTOR DOWN A SHAFT ON THE CURTIS GREEN ROOF, HOPING TO GET A GLIMPSE INTO SOME OF THE NEARBY ROOMS. IT HAD JUST ABOUT REACHED GROUND LEVEL WHEN THE NYLON LINE SNAPPED. IT MADE A HELL OF A ROW AS IT CLATTERED DOWN, AND I PREPARED TO RUN, BUT NO ALARMS WENT OFF AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, I NOTICED SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT. IT HAD TAKEN AROUND FIVE SECONDS FOR THE LIDAR TO CRASH DOWN, WHICH, AT A ROUGH ESTIMATE, MEANT IT HAD FALLEN FREE FOR AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY METRES. THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT A LONG WAY UNDERGROUND, AND THERE WERE NO BASEMENT ROOMS MARKED ON THE PLANS IN THAT LOCATION. I WAS PRETTY SURE I HAD FOUND THE SHADOW ARCHIVE: NOW I JUST HAD TO FIND A WAY IN.

CHARLES IS RIGHT, THE THREATS TO THE EAST ARE GROWING BY THE DAY: IN THE SOUTHERN REGION THE OTTOMANS ARE RESTLESS, AND IN THE NORTH THE THREE EMPERORS ARE A GROWING THREAT TO OUR INFLUENCE. THE FOREIGN OFFICE SEEM PARALYSED, FOCUSSED ENTIRELY ON FORMING ALLIANCES AND UNABLE TO DETERMINE THEIR BEST STRATEGY. I THINK THEY ARE MISTAKEN IN THEIR OUTLOOK; THEY FOCUS TOO MUCH ON TREATIES AND NOT ENOUGH ON REALPOLITIK. AS VON ROCHAU WROTE "THE LAW OF POWER GOVERNS THE WORLD OF STATES JUST AS THE LAW OF GRAVITY GOVERNS THE PHYSICAL WORLD". AND WE ARE PERHAPS "TOO MUCH INCLINED TO OVERLOOK THE REAL MIGHT OF THE MORE POWERFUL AND THE INEVITABILITY OF ITS POLITICAL INFLUENCE".

OUR TASK NOW IS NOT TO CHOOSE A FAVOURED PARTNER TO CONTROL THE OTHERS. THAT WAY RISKS WAR. AN ALLIANCE WILL ENCOURAGE A COUNTER ALLIANCE AND A DANGEROUS ESCALATION, INSTEAD OUR STRATEGY SHOULD BE TO MAINTAIN AN, ADMITTEDLY UNEASY, PEACE BETWEEN THE EMPERORS. TOGETHER THEY ARE THE BIGGEST POLITICAL THREAT TO OUR EMPIRE, BUT AS ENEMIES OF ONE ANOTHER THEY ALSO THREATEN OUR TRADING ROUTES. WE NEED TO INDUCE THEM TO WORK TOGETHER WHILE PREVENTING THEM FROM FORMING A POWER BLOC AGAINST OUR INTEREST. OUR MOST IMPORTANT WEAPON IN THIS IS CONFUSION AND MILD DISTRUST. THE BEST OUTCOME WOULD BE TO ENCOURAGE A DYSFUNCTIONAL ALLIANCE BETWEEN ALL THREE THAT MAKES IT HARD FOR THE EMPERORS TO FIGHT ONE ANOTHER OR US. AND IN THE OTTOMAN CRISIS I THINK I SENSE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO JUST THAT.

I AM STILL NOT SURE WHICH OF THE TWO CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF THE UNDERGROUND ARCHIVE. IT WILL HAVE APPEALED TO BLACK AS A WAY TO PROVIDE SECURITY TO HIS OPERATION, BUT A CIVIL ENGINEERING PROJECT OF THIS SCALE DOESN’T SEEM LIKE HIS SORT OF THING, SO I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN CONCEIVED BY CHARLES GREY. THE FIRST TUBE LINE HAD BEEN OPENED IN 1863 AND LONDON WAS FULL OF LABOURERS AND ENGINEERS WITH THE SKILLS NEEDED TO BUILD THE SHADOW ARCHIVE DEEP BENEATH NEW SCOTLAND YARD. GETTING ACCESS WAS NOT GOING TO BE EASY WITHOUT HARRY’S HELP, BUT I STILL DIDN’T HAVE ENOUGH TO GIVE HIM THE EXCUSE HE WOULD NEED TO GET OPENLY INVOLVED. MY RECONNAISSANCE HAD HELPED ME TO FIND THE ARCHIVE, BUT IT DIDN’T GIVE ME ANY OBVIOUS WAY IN. THE DUCT THAT HAD COST ME THE LIDAR WAS FAR TOO NARROW FOR ME TO SCALE, AND ACCESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR WAS TOO RISKY, SO I TOOK A GAMBLE AND SPENT ANOTHER MISERABLE FORTNIGHT EXPLORING THE LABYRINTH OF SEWERS AND TUNNEL SYSTEMS AROUND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD.
GPS WAS USELESS DOWN THERE AND I COULD EASILY HAVE GOT LOST, BUT I MARKED THE TUNNELS, AND ON OCCASIONS USED THESEUS’ TRICK OF A BALL OF TWINE TO HELP ME NAVIGATE BACK. I MOVED QUIETLY AND KEPT AN EYE OUT FOR SENSORS. I HAD NO IDEA WHETHER THE SHADOW ARCHIVE WAS STILL OPERATIONAL OR NOT, BUT IF IT WAS THEN SECURITY WOULD BE TIGHT, AND I COULDN’T BE SURE IF THEY WERE USING INFRARED OR SEISMOMETERS FOR INTRUSION DETECTION, SO I LAYERED UP WITH INSULATION AND MOVED SLOWLY. IT WAS HORRIBLE. I WAS HOT, DAMP AND THE AIR SMELLED OF SEWAGE AND MOULD. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GIVE UP WHEN I FOUND A STEEL DOOR MARKED WITH THE INITIALS VRI, VICTORIA REGINA IMPERATRIX.

IT WAS INCONGRUOUS IN THAT DARK AND DANK TUNNEL, BUT MORE SIGNIFICANTLY IT CARRIED THE TRADE MARK TANN ON THE LOCK. JOHN TANN WAS ONE OF THE TOP SAFE MAKERS IN VICTORIAN LONDON AND I HAD CRACKED ONE OR TWO OF HIS SAFES IN MY OTHER LIFE AS A CAT BURGLAR. THIS WAS BIG AND HEAVY AND VERY RUSTY. THAT TOLD ME TWO THINGS: NO-ONE HAD USED IT IN A VERY LONG TIME, AND NO-ONE HAD UPGRADED IT IN JUST AS LONG. IF THE ROOM BEHIND IT WAS STILL IN USE THEN SOMEONE WOULD HAVE BEEN MAINTAINING THE LOCK, SO ALL MY PRECAUTIONS WERE PROBABLY UNNECESSARY, BUT NO-ONE HAD PAID FOR A TANN SAFE WITHOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO HIDE SO I DECIDED TO TACKLE THE LOCK AND AFTER ANOTHER EIGHTEEN HOURS OF GRIM WORK I WAS IN. I HAD FOUND THE SHADOW ARCHIVE.

THE APRIL UPRISING IN BULGARIA AND ITS BRUTAL SUPPRESSION BY THE TURKS HAS CAUSED OUTRAGE IN THE CHANCELLERIES OF EUROPE THERE IS A RISK THAT RUSSIA WILL TAKE THIS AS THE EXCUSE IT SEEKS TO ENGAGE THE OTTOMANS AND IF THEY ACT AND TAKE CONSTANTINOPLE THEN OUR TRADING ROUTES TO INDIA WILL BE UNDER THREATAT HOME GLADSTONES PAMPHLET BULGARIAN HORRORS AND THE QUESTION OF THE EAST HAS STIRRED A PUBLIC APPETITE FOR ACTION WHICH COULD LEAD TO SUPPORT FOR INTERVENTION AND MAKE THINGS DIFFICULT FOR THE PRIME MINISTER HE IS FACED WITH MORTONS FORK IF HE SUPPORTS ACTION THEN IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO CONDEMN RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IF HE COUNSELS INACTION THEN HE RISK APPEARING WEAK AND CALLOUS AT HOME AND ABROAD IT MAY APPEAR UNFORTUNATE THAT OUR POLITICAL LEADERS ARE UNABLE TO AGREE ON POLICY STRATEGY OR TACTICS AND IT IS TRUE THAT THIS COULD LEAD TO CONFUSION ABOUT OUR AIMS BUT ON REFLECTION I THINK THAT THE PUBLIC DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN GLADSTONE AND DISRAELI PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY THEIR DISPUTE CONDUCTED IN PARLIAMENT AND THE PRESS DEMONSTRATES TO THE WORLD THE TWO FACES OF THE EMPIRE AT THE SAME TIME MORALLY ENGAGED AND YET PRUDENT THIS MAY ALLOW US TO PROCEED WITH DISCRETION TO TRY TO INFLUENCE THE ACTORS AND TO DIRECT THE PLAY AWAY FROM THE GLARE OF THE FOOTLIGHTS IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO ENGAGE THE LEAGUE OF THE THREE EMPERORS TO OUR CAUSEBISMARCK IS PARTICULARLY KEEN TO MAINTAIN A BALANCE OF POWER IN THE REGION AND TO AVOID FURTHER WAR AND HE WILL NOT NEED TO BE CONVINCED THAT AN UNBRIDLED RUSSIA IS NOT TO HIS ADVANTAGE SO I THINK WE CAN RELY ON HIM TO REIN IN RUSSIAS EXPANSIONARY VISIONON THE OTHER HAND THE LEAGUE ITSELF MAY PRESENT A LONGER TERM THREAT TO THE EMPIRE GIVEN THE BREADTH OF ITS INFLUENCE IN NORTHERN EUROPE AND WE MUST TREAD CAREFULLYTHE EMPERORS ENVOYS WILL BE MEETING IN REICHSTADT SOON TO DETERMINE THE RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS AND I NEED A PLAN TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME AS ALWAYS OUR STRATEGY MUST BE TO SOW CONFUSION AND ON THIS I PLAN TO ASK FOR ADVICE FROM BARON PLAYFAIR HE HAS RECENTLY CONCLUDED HIS COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY INTO THE CIVIL SERVICE AND IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO CONTROL AN AGENDA IT MUST BE OUR OWN CIVIL SERVANTS

IT WAS DARK AND DUSTY IN THE SHADOW ARCHIVE, BUT AT LEAST I HAD FOUND IT. THE SHELVES MARCHED OFF INTO THE GLOOM, AND MOST OF THEM WERE EMPTY, THOUGH THERE WAS THE OCCASIONAL BOX OF PAPERS MARKED SA, WHICH HAD CLEARLY BEEN FORGOTTEN IN THE MOVE. THEY WOULD BE INTERESTING TO READ LATER, BUT NOTHING IN THEM LOOKED IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO HAVE EXCITED MY CO-CONSPIRATOR, WHOEVER THAT MIGHT BE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO GET DISCOURAGED, BUT I NEEDED TO RECOVER THE LIDAR SO I CARRIED ON SEARCHING FOR THE CHIMNEY. I EVENTUALLY FOUND IT AT THE BACK OF THE STACKS, BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE LIDAR OR OF ANY DISTURBANCE TO SUGGEST IT HAD FALLEN THAT FAR, SO I GUESSED IT MIGHT HAVE GOT CAUGHT ON A LEDGE HIGHER UP. FORTUNATELY THE CHIMNEY WAS FAIRLY WIDE, BUT NOT SO WIDE THAT I COULDN’T BRIDGE IT, AND ALL THOSE HOURS ON THE CLIMBING WALL PAID OFF AS I CLIMBED UP LOOKING FOR THE LOST MACHINE. AS I SUSPECTED, IT HAD CAUGHT ON ONE OF THE LEDGES DESIGNED TO CATCH RAIN, SO I MADE READY TO LOWER IT BACK DOWN, BUT AS I MOVED LOOSE BRICKS TO STEADY MYSELF PART OF THE INNER WALL COLLAPSED, AND TO MY AMAZEMENT I FOUND MYSELF STARING INTO A CONTROL ROOM. IT WAS VERY JULES VERNE AND WOULDN’T HAVE LOOKED OUT OF PLACE ON THE BRIDGE OF THE NAUTILUS. IT MUST HAVE BEEN CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY ONCE, ALL BRASS AND POLISHED INSTRUMENTS. THERE WAS A MAP ON THE WALL COVERED IN SMALL BULBS THAT I ASSUMED WOULD HAVE LIT UP TO SIGNIFY ACTIVITY, AND A BANK OF FINE NINETEENTH CENTURY TELEGRAPH MACHINES IN POLISHED WALNUT. UNLESS I WAS MISTAKEN I HAD FOUND DOUGLAS BLACK’S COMMAND CENTRE. UNDER A LARGE CIRCULAR OAK TABLE IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM THERE WAS A FILING SYSTEM WITH DRAWERS CONTAINING MAPS OF EVERY NATION, AND THE TABLE COULD BE TURNED LIKE A RESTAURANT LAZY SUSAN. THE WALLS WERE LINED WITH BRASS BOUND LEDGERS, AND FOLDERS MARKED WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE MISSION CODE NAMES. IN AMONGST THEM WAS THE MOST AMAZING FIND, BLACK’S CODE BOOK. IT CONTAINED A NUMBER OF KEYS AND, BEST OF ALL, A LIST OF CIPHERS AND WHEN AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE USED. IT WOULD BE WORTH A FORTUNE ON THE BIBLIOPHILE BLACK MARKET, BUT I DIDN’T FEEL LIKE SELLING IT. HARRY MIGHT BE INTERESTED, IF ONLY FOR HISTORICAL REASONS, BUT IF NOT THEN THIS WOULD FIND A HOME IN MY OWN PRIVATE COLLECTION.
I TOOK A SEAT BY THE TELEGRAPH AND PUT MY FEET UP, OPENING THE CODE BOOK AT RANDOM TO READ: “AS WITH THE THREE EMPERORS OPERATION, IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO ENHANCE OPERATIONAL SECURITY DURING THE OPERATION ITSELF. IN THAT CASE, WE MOVED FROM PURELY LETTER SUBSTITUTION CRYPTOGRAMS TO TRANSPOSITION CIPHERS AND, AT THE URGING OF BARON PLAYFAIR, OTHER MORE COMPLICATED CIPHERS LIKE THE VIGENERE AND PLAYFAIR CIPHERS AND VARIANTS UPON THEM.” I WAS COMPLETELY IMMERSED IN WHAT I WAS READING, AND THEN IT HIT ME ...

INFILTRATING THE DELIBERATIONS OF OUR ENEMIES IS A PRINCIPAL GOAL, BUT, FOLLOWING MY DISCUSSIONS WITH PLAYFAIR, I HAVE COME TO SEE THAT THE CLASSICAL STRATEGY OF TRYING TO TURN A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE DELEGATIONS IS BOTH RISKY AND UNNECESSARY. ANY APPROACH TO SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL RISKS SIGNALLING OUR INTENTIONS AND UNDERMINES OUR ABILITY TO ADAPT OUR PLANS. SECRECY IS EVERYTHING. AS PLAYFAIR POINTS OUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS OFTEN HAVE LITTLE INFLUENCE ANYWAY. THEY ARE THERE TO PRESENT A POINT OF VIEW, AND, THE BEST OF THEM AT LEAST, TO LISTEN, BUT THEY HAVE LITTLE AUTHORITY. THE JUNIOR OFFICIALS ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE ALMOST TOTAL CONTROL OF EVENTS. THEY SET THE AGENDA IN DISCUSSION WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THEIR SENIORS, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY TAKE THE RECORD OF THE MEETING. AFTER THE DELEGATES HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES IT IS THAT RECORD THAT BECOMES THE REALITY. WE DO NOT NEED TO BE THERE, OR EVEN TO KNOW WHAT WAS SAID. WE NEED ONLY TO KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN RECORDED AS THE TRUTH, AND WHERE POSSIBLE TO SHAPE THAT TRUTH IN OUR BEST INTERESTS. THIS I BELIEVE TO BE AN ENTIRELY NEW STRATEGY IN THE WORLD OF DIPLOMACY, AND I AM PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP IT WITH THE HELP OF SUCH A DISTINGUISHED FRIEND. PLAYFAIR IS A MAN OF CUNNING AND I ENJOY WORKING WITH HIM. NOWHERE HAS THIS CUNNING BEEN MORE EFFECTIVE THAN IN HIS STRATEGY FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THE REICHSTADT MEETING.
ALEXANDER, FRANZ JOSEF, GORCHAKOV AND ANDRASSY MET TO AGREE TERMS ON RUSSIA’S INVOLVEMENT IN THE BALKANS, AND THERE WAS A REAL RISK THAT THEY WOULD UNITE AND FIGHT TO CONTROL OUR TRADE ROUTES. WITH SUCH HIGH-LEVEL INVOLVEMENT IN THE DISCUSSIONS IT WAS CLEAR THAT WE WOULD HAVE LITTLE TO NO HOPE OF INFLUENCING THE PRINCIPALS AND SO WE DECIDED TO FOLLOW THE PLAYFAIR STRATEGY. APPLYING CAREFUL PRESSURE TO THE JUNIOR MEMBERS OF THE RETINUES, OUR AGENTS AND OFFICERS PERSUADED THEM TO REPORT ON THE PROCEEDINGS, PROVIDING US WITH THE INTELLIGENCE WE NEEDED TO PREPARE FOR THE FORTHCOMING WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. BUT OF FAR GREATER SIGNIFICANCE, THEY WERE ABLE TO ENSURE MAXIMUM CONFUSION AMONG OUR ENEMIES BY THE MOST MARVELLOUS STRATAGEM, WHICH I WILL REFER TO AS THE PLAYFAIR GAMBIT. THE OFFICIALS WERE ABLE TO PERSUADE THEIR LEADERS THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER NOT TO TAKE OFFICIAL MINUTES OF THE MEETING. WHILE WE RECEIVED A FULL AND ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF ALL THE DISCUSSIONS, THE RUSSIAN AND AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN OFFICIALS WERE LEFT ONLY WITH INFORMAL PERSONAL NOTES OF THE DISCUSSIONS AND NO AGREED RECORD OF THE MEETING OR ITS AGREED OUTCOMES. WE FULLY INTEND TO EXPLOIT THIS UNCERTAINTY AT THE FORTHCOMING CONFERENCE IN CONSTANTINOPLE.

EXACTLY WHAT OR WHO HAD HIT ME I WASN’T SURE, BUT BY THE TIME I CAME AROUND THEY HAD LONG GONE. IF YOU WILL EXCUSE THE PUN, IT WAS A PROFESSIONAL HIT. JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF FORCE TO KNOCK ME OUT, PROBABLY NO PERMANENT DAMAGE.
THE ROOM HAD BEEN EXPERTLY DISASSEMBLED. THE SHELVES WERE EMPTIED OF BLACK’S MISSION FILES, AND MUCH OF THE STEAMPUNK TECHNOLOGY HAD BEEN TAKEN APART, PRESUMABLY TO MAKE SURE IT DIDN’T CONTAIN ANY FURTHER SECRETS. THE BIG, BEAUTIFUL ROUND TABLE HAD BEEN CLEARED AND I LEANT ON IT TO STEADY MYSELF AS MY HEAD SWAM.
I GUESSED THAT WHOEVER HAD FOLLOWED ME INTO THE TUNNELS AND ON INTO THE HEADQUARTERS MUST HAVE KNOWN WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. IT WAS TOO MUCH OF A COINCIDENCE THAT THEY HAD FOUND ME HERE. PROBABLY THEY WERE CONNECTED WITH THE EMAILS THAT FIRST GOT ME INTERESTED IN BLACK, BUT, IN A CONFUSED STATE AFTER MY BLACKOUT, I WAS PUZZLED. WHY HAD THEY INVOLVED ME? PERHAPS THEY JUST DIDN’T KNOW HOW TO FIND THE SHADOW ARCHIVE AND HOPED I WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP. PERHAPS THEY WANTED TO IMPLICATE ME IN THE THEFT OF THE SHADOW ARCHIVE PAPERS. IN THAT CASE THEY SHOULD HAVE HIT ME HARDER! I WASN’T GOING TO HANG AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO GET CAUGHT.
SOMETHING WAS NAGGING AT ME: NONE OF THE PAPERS I HAD SEEN LOOKED INTERESTING ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ALL THIS EFFORT. I TURNED MY HEAD CAUTIOUSLY, TRYING TO IGNORE THE THROBBING BEHIND MY EAR, AND LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM ONE MORE TIME TO SEE WHAT WE WERE MISSING. AS I DID SO MY FOOT CAUGHT ON SOMETHING AND I BENT DOWN TO PICK IT UP.
WHEN THEY HIT ME I HAD BEEN SITTING READING BLACK’S CODE BOOK. IT WAS FULL OF MARVELLOUS, IF DATED, IDEAS ON CRYPTOGRAPHY AND INFORMATION SECURITY, AND I HAD JUST BEEN READING THE SECTION ON TRANSPOSITION CIPHERS. IT SEEMED HE WAS PARTICULARLY KEEN ON COLUMNAR TRANSPOSITIONS, AND WAS ARGUING THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO READ OFF THE CIPHERTEXT COLUMN BY COLUMN TO CONFUSE ENEMY CRYPTANALYSTS. I WAS MUSING ON JUST HOW SECURE THAT WOULD BE WHEN THE WORLD WENT DARK. LUCKILY, AS I HAD FALLEN I HAD DROPPED THE BOOK AND IT HAD SLIPPED UNDER THE TABLE. SOMEHOW THEY HAD MISSED IT DURING THE SEARCH, AND THERE IT WAS HIDDEN IN THE SHADOWS.
I TOOK A DEEP BREATH TO SLOW THE SPINNING BEHIND MY EYES AND PICKED THE BOOK UP, BUT AS I PULLED MYSELF UPRIGHT AGAIN THE TABLE TOP SHIFTED SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE. I STRUGGLED TO REGAIN MY BALANCE AND THE TABLE MOVED AGAIN, AND THIS TIME I HEARD A DISTINCT CLICK. AS I SHIFTED MY WEIGHT THE TABLE ROTATED BACK, AND THERE IT WAS ONCE MORE, A SOFT, METALLIC CLINK AS A RATCHET TOOTH ENGAGED. I STOOD UP, GRABBED AT THE TABLE AND PULLED SIDEWAYS; IT TURNED AGAIN CLICKING SEVERAL TIMES AS IT DID SO. IT WAS A NOISE I KNEW VERY WELL. THE TUMBLERS ON A SAFE MADE THE SAME SOUND, THOUGH MUCH, MUCH QUIETER.

THE CHAOS AND CONFUSION THAT FOLLOWED THE REICHSTADT MEETING WAS MORE COMPLETE THAN I HAD ANY RIGHT TO HOPE. THE PLAYFAIR GAMBIT WAS AN OUTSTANDING SUCCESS. THE DELEGATES FROM RUSSIA AND AUSTRO-HUNGARY EACH HAD A CLEAR VIEW OF WHAT HAD BEEN AGREED, AND THESE VIEWS WERE ENTIRELY DIVERGENT. EVEN BETTER, THE RECORDS OF THE MEETING WERE ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT OF ONE ANOTHER. AT THE URGING OF OUR AGENTS WITHIN THE SEPARATE COURTS, THE MINUTES WERE DICTATED SEPARATELY BY THE TWO FOREIGN MINISTERS, ANDRASSY AND GORCHAKOV, SO AS “TO ENSURE THE DEEPEST POSSIBLE UNDERSTANDING OF THE AGREED OUTCOMES”. THERE WAS NO SIGNED FORMAL CONVENTION, NOR EVEN AN AGREED PROTOCOL. OUR SUBTLE CAMPAIGN OF WHISPERS AND MISDIRECTION ENSURED THAT NEITHER SIDE ENTIRELY TRUSTED THE OTHER SO THESE MINUTES WERE NEVER SHARED.
THE DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING AUSTRIAN ANNEXATION IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVENIA WILL CONFUSE HISTORIANS AND DIPLOMATS FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. IT HAS ALREADY CONFUSED THE PRINCIPALS IN THIS AFFAIR, AND NO ONE IN THE FOREIGN OFFICE CAN MAKE SENSE OF THEM AT ALL, DESPITE THE GREAT CARE TAKEN BY THE OFFICERS OF THE SHADOW ARCHIVE TO RECORD THEM ACCURATELY. THERE IS TALK OF THE NEED FOR FURTHER MEETINGS OF THE GREAT POWERS, AND THIS TIME I WILL MAKE SURE THAT BRITAIN WILL BE AT THE TABLE TO INFLUENCE THE DELIBERATIONS AND TO PROTECT OUR INTERESTS.
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF HER MAJESTY AND THE PRIME MINISTER, IF NOT THAT OF ALL HER MINISTERS, THIS IS CLOSE TO THE PERFECT OUTCOME. DISCUSSION IS DISPLACING WAR, AND LOW-LEVEL DISTRUST IS INHIBITING THE SORT OF ORGANISED ALLIANCE THAT MIGHT DIMINISH OUR INFLUENCE OVER THE GATEWAY TO THE EAST.
THE FORTHCOMING CONFERENCE IN CONSTANTINOPLE WILL, FOR THE FIRST TIME, INVOLVE OUR GOVERNMENT IN THE DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING THE FUTURE GOVERNANCE OF THE REGION. LORD SALISBURY WILL ARGUE FOR THE CREATION OF AUTONOMOUS REGIONS UNDER BULGARIAN RULE, IN THE HOPE OF REDUCING TENSIONS AND ELIMINATING THE EXCUSE THAT RUSSIA NEEDS TO ENGAGE IN WAR. IF HE SUCCEEDS THEN WE WILL HAVE ESTABLISHED A COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA CONCERNING ITS TERRITORIAL AMBITIONS IN CENTRAL ASIA, RESOLVING THE CONFLICT WITH OUR OWN STRATEGIC AIMS. EVEN IF THIS PROVES TO BE TOO MUCH FOR OUR NEGOTIATORS WE CAN AT LEAST HOPE TO BUY TIME TO MAKE OUR OWN PREPARATIONS AND TO MANIPULATE OUR ALLIES AND ENEMIES. I WILL CONCENTRATE ON DEVELOPING FURTHER CONFUSION, SPREADING MISINFORMATION AND AS MUCH DISTRUST AS I CAN MANAGE. IF THE TALKS FAIL WE SHOULD AT LEAST ENSURE THAT NO GRAND BARGAIN IS STRUCK AGAINST OUR INTERESTS, AND NO MAJOR ALLIANCE IS FORMED TO DIMINISH US.
THE MEDITERRANEAN IS A CHOKE POINT FOR THE TRADE ROUTES FROM THE EAST. WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT ALLOW OTHERS TO STRANGLE THE FLOW OF GOODS AND PEOPLE THAT ENRICH US. NO THREAT IS GREATER TO THE HEALTH OF THE EMPIRE AND NO ACTION IS BEYOND CONTEMPLATION IN OUR EFFORTS TO REMOVE THE THREAT.

I CHECKED AROUND TO SEE IF I WAS BEING WATCHED, BUT THE ROOM WAS DEFINITELY EMPTY AND I COULDN’T HEAR ANYTHING OUTSIDE SO I DUCKED DOWN TO INSPECT THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TABLE. THE TOP WAS HIGHLY POLISHED WITH A GRACEFUL SLOPE TO THE EDGE, THICKENING AS IT APPROACHED THE CENTRE COLUMN. THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MECHANISM TO SUGGEST THAT IT WAS ANYTHING MORE THAN IT APPEARED TO BE - A GRAND WORKTABLE AT THE CENTRE OF A GRAND CONTROL ROOM. I PUSHED, POKED AND LISTENED FOR ANOTHER MECHANISM, BUT THERE WAS NOTHING MECHANICAL THAT I COULD FIND. THE THICKENING OF THE TOP AND THE BULK OF THE COLUMN DID ALLOW ROOM FOR A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MECHANISM THOUGH, AND TUCKED UP IN THE FOLD WHERE THE TOP JOINED THE COLUMN THERE WAS A SMALL METAL PLATE BEARING A MAKER’S MARK.
MY HEART SKIPPED; THE DOOR TO THE SHADOW ARCHIVE CARRIED A SIMILAR PLATE INSCRIBED WITH THE TRADEMARK OF JOHN TANN, THE LOCKSMITH WHO MANUFACTURED THE SECURITY SYSTEM ON THE ENTRANCE. IT LOOKED LIKE HE HAD ALSO MADE THIS TABLE. HE WAS NOT A FURNITURE MAKER, AND THERE COULD ONLY BE ONE REASON HE HAD MADE THIS ONE. IT MUST BE PART OF A LOCK MECHANISM. HE WAS THE LEADING SAFE MAKER IN VICTORIAN LONDON, AND IF BLACK HAD FELT THE NEED FOR HIM TO BUILD A SAFE IN THE HEART OF THE SHADOW ARCHIVE IT COULD ONLY BE BECAUSE THERE WERE SECRETS THAT WERE TOO DARK EVEN FOR THE SECURITY OF THE ARCHIVE ITSELF. MAYBE THIS IS WHAT MY ATTACKER WAS REALLY AFTER, AND IF SO THEY HAD STRUCK WAY TOO SOON. I SHOULD THANK THEM REALLY, WITHOUT MY ACHING HEAD I WOULD HAVE BEEN UNLIKELY TO DISCOVER TANN’S MECHANISM, BUT THAT THOUGHT REMINDED ME: I WAS STILL VULNERABLE DOWN IN THE SHADOWS. I DIDN’T THINK THERE WAS ANYONE ELSE AROUND, BUT I COULDN’T BE SURE, AND I NEEDED BACKUP. UNTIL NOW THERE HADN’T BEEN ENOUGH TO GET HARRY INVOLVED IN THIS ADVENTURE. I STILL WASN’T CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO HELP OUT AS I WASN’T REALLY SURE THAT NATIONAL SECURITY WAS INVOLVED, BUT I WAS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN HE WOULD WANT TO SEE THIS. I NEEDED TO GET OUT SAFELY AND COME BACK WITH A TEAM SO WE COULD PROPERLY EXPLORE THE ARCHIVE AND FIND OUT WHAT THE TANN SAFE STORED.
BEFORE I LEFT I TOOK ONE MORE LOOK AROUND, GATHERING THE FEW PAPERS THAT WERE LEFT, AND PUTTING THE CODEBOOK SECURELY INTO A POCKET OF MY BACKPACK. I STILL COULDN’T BELIEVE THAT MY ATTACKERS HAD LEFT IT BEHIND, BUT PERHAPS THEY MISSED IT IN THE GLOOM, IN THEIR EXCITEMENT TO GATHER THE GOVERNMENT PAPERS WHICH THEY HAD FOUND. IF NOTHING ELSE CAME OUT OF THIS I WAS CERTAIN THAT THE CODEBOOK WAS WORTH READING. I HADN’T HAD TIME TO INSPECT IT PROPERLY, BUT THE SECTION ON THE VIGENERE CIPHER LOOKED ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING!

ELLIOT HAS DONE HIMSELF NO FAVOURS IN ARGUING THE PRAGMATIC LINE AT THE CONSTANTINOPLE CONFERENCE. DISRAELI CAUGHT THE MOOD WITH HIS PAMPHLET, AND THE PEOPLE DO NOT SEEM TO AGREE THAT BULGARIAN LIVES COUNT FOR LESS IN THE CALCULUS OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. I THINK SALISBURY PLANS TO MOVE HIM ON, PERHAPS BACK TO VIENNA. HE WAS SUCCESSFUL THERE. IT IS MOST UNUSUAL TO HAVE ANNOYED BOTH SALISBURY AND GLADSTONE, BUT I HAVE SOME SYMPATHY WITH HIS VIEWS. THE TERRIBLE EVENTS THAT HAVE PRECIPITATED THIS CRISIS CANNOT BE UNDONE, AND THERE ARE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. RUSSIAN AGGRESSION MUST STILL BE IMPEDED IF WE ARE TO RETAIN OUR INFLUENCE IN THE REGION. MY AGENTS TELL ME THAT THE RUSSIAN EMPEROR MET WITH THE AUSTRIANS AT BUDAPEST AT THE START OF THE YEAR, TO DISCUSS THEIR INTENTIONS IN THE EVENT OF WAR, AND IT IS RUMOURED THAT THEY PLAN TO RESTRUCTURE THE BALKANS IN AN EFFORT TO CONTROL THE SLAVIC MOVES FOR A UNIFIED STATE. IT IS MY OWN VIEW THAT THE SLAVS MAY BE A MOST USEFUL ALLY IN BLOCKING THE EXPANSIONIST MOVEMENT IN RUSSIA, AND I HAVE ADVISED THE GOVERNMENT TO INVITE THE AUSTRIANS TO JOIN US IN MARCH TO SEE IF WE CAN EFFECT A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION TO UNTANGLE THIS GORDIAN KNOT. PERHAPS WE CAN FIND SOMETHING MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR THEM THAT WILL WEAKEN THEIR DEPENDENCE ON TSAR ALEXANDER II. IF WE FAIL THEN I FEAR THAT MORE DIRECT ACTION MAY NEED TO BE TAKEN. I HAVE IN MY POSSESSION COPIES OF CERTAIN LETTERS THAT HAVE BEEN CIRCULATING IN FRANZ JOSEF’S COURT THAT I THINK MIGHT BE SUFFICIENTLY EMBARRASSING TO CONCENTRATE MINDS ON THE ADVANTAGES OF WORKING WITH US.
INSTABILITY IN THE REGION IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO BE FEARED, BUT PERHAPS WE CAN CONVINCE THE AUSTRIANS THAT STABILITY WOULD BE WORSE, IF IT IS SECURED BY THE RUSSIANS. IF WE CANNOT TURN AUSTRIA TO OUR CAUSE, IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO UNDERTAKE A CAMPAIGN TO STIR UP THE LOCAL POPULATIONS. PERHAPS RUSSIA WOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE GETTING INVOLVED IF THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO SECURE A STABLE SETTLEMENT BY FORCE OF ARMS ALONE. THE LESSONS OF THE CRIMEA HAVE NOT BEEN FORGOTTEN BY ANY OF ITS COMBATANTS. MODERN WARFARE IS GROWING INDUSTRIAL IN ITS SCALE, AND THE COSTS OF CONFLICT ARE PROHIBITIVE. I AM CERTAIN THAT THE STORIES TOLD BY NIGHTINGALE OF THE HORRIFIC WOUNDS SUFFERED THERE HAVE SOFTENED THE APPETITE OF SOME FOR OPEN CONFLICT, AND PERHAPS THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HER MAJESTY’S SUPPORT OF THE SHADOW ARCHIVE AND ALL ITS WORKS. I MUST NOT LET HER DOWN, NOR THE EMPIRE.
